# An R/Bioconductor package for gene set analysis

## Overview of piano

Piano is used for running gene set analysis (GSA) using a selection of available methods (some of which are also implemented in separate packages or other software) and starting from different kinds of gene level statistics. The advantage with using piano is that all of these methods can be run using the same setup, resulting in minimal effort for the user when switching between methods. Additionally, piano contains a new approach which divides the gene set results into directionality classes,
giving deeper information about the underlying gene pattern. Further on, piano contains functions to perform consensus analysis, i.e. combining the results of multiple GSA runs. For details, see the publication below.
